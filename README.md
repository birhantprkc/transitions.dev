# Transitions.dev

Transitions.dev is an interactive collection of reusable CSS transitions. Each card on the index page demonstrates a different interaction pattern and ships a copy-ready, portable CSS snippet for each.

Live site: https://transitions.dev/

## Transitions

| # | Name | What it shows |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Card resize** | Smooth card resize transition. |
| 2 | **Number pop-in** | Digit flip with blur and stagger. |
| 3 | **Notification badge** | Diagonal slide with spring pop-in. |
| 4 | **Text states swap** | Text swap transition with blur. |
| 5 | **Menu dropdown** | Origin-aware open / close transition. |
| 6 | **Modal open / close** | Modal transition with scale. |
| 7 | **Panel reveal** | Panel open / close transition. |
| 8 | **Page side-by-side** | Forward / back page transition. |
| 9 | **Icon swap** | Scale and blur icon swap. |

Each card has a copy button that emits a self-contained CSS snippet: semantic CSS custom properties on `:root`, the transition rules namespaced under `t-*` classes, and a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` guard — so you can paste the snippet into any project and apply it to any component without pulling in demo-specific markup or sizing.

## Use as an agent skill

The same nine transitions are packaged as an installable agent skill so AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, …) can apply them directly inside your project.

```bash
npx skills add Jakubantalik/transitions-dev
```

Source: [Jakubantalik/transitions-dev](https://github.com/Jakubantalik/transitions-dev). The skill is generated from `index.html` in this repo, so its snippets always match what the showcase site demonstrates.

## Files

- `index.html` — main showcase page with all nine transitions and per-card "copy CSS" buttons.
- `assets/` — icons, favicons, and the social-share OG image.
- `site.webmanifest`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` — PWA/SEO metadata.
